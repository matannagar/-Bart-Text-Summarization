Harry Potter is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the Harry Potter series of novels written by British author J.K. Rowling. In the story, Harry is a young wizard who discovers that he is famous in the wizarding world for surviving an attack by the evil dark wizard Lord Voldemort as a baby. He learns about his past and his own magical powers at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he makes friends with fellow students Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.

One exciting story involving Harry and his wand might be when he first learns how to use it in the wizarding world. In the first novel of the series, "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone," Harry receives his wand from Ollivander, the wandmaker, who tells him that his wand is made of holly and has a phoenix feather core. This wand is said to be the "brother" of Voldemort's wand, and Ollivander reveals that they are the only two known to have such cores.

At first, Harry has difficulty using his wand and is unable to perform even simple spells. But with the help of his friends Ron and Hermione, as well as the school's headmaster Albus Dumbledore, Harry learns how to control his magic and becomes a skilled wizard. He uses his wand to fight against Voldemort and his followers, the Death Eaters, in a series of battles that take place throughout the series.

In the final novel, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," Harry, Ron, and Hermione set out on a dangerous mission to destroy the remaining Horcruxes, objects that contain pieces of Voldemort's soul. Along the way, they encounter many challenges and confrontations, including a battle with the Death Eaters at the wizarding bank Gringotts. In the end, Harry is able to defeat Voldemort once and for all with the help of his wand, which chooses him as its true master.
