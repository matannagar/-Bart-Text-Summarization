To FIX:
1. buttons not on the right side
2. when closing the registartion window, dont activate download file
4. summary background should not be a picture, but a color
5. warnings deprications
6. minimized venv
7. ner detecting words without spaces (e.g: cap -- > handicap )
8. allow ner from a shared link
9. linkedin short url 

To DO:
1. organize github folder
2. design the git page
3. test additional docs
4. "protect" entities action if no summary was loaded.
5. 

***check scan entities with the url share link!
** prettier popup message when file was selected


** download summary from shared link
** change variables names in index.html
** long summaries variables via url ? need to check that url is not cut (maybe find a way to shorten)

** things that should be modified:
1. path to save files from folder (in application.py)
2. load graph from server (create_graph in index.js file (currently from widget server))
3. path to fi_dictionary.xls (create_dictionary.py)
4. registartion form : index.html http://localhost/test/form.html"

functions to test:
1. ner_graph (visualize, relatives)
2.
