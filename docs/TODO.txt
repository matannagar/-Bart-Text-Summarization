To FIX:
1. buttons not on the right side
2. when closing the registartion window, dont activate download file
4. summary background should not be a picture, but a color

To DO:
1. organize github folder
2. design the git page
3. test additional docs

***check scan entities with the url share link!
** prettier popup message when file was selected

HOW TO CREATE TREE
- find entities within summarization
- find entities within description of above entities 
- perform step 2 over and over until no more terms are found

** download summary from shared link
** change variables names in index.html
** long summaries variables via url ? need to check that url is not cut (maybe find a way to shorten)
