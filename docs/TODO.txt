To FIX:
2. when closing the registartion window, dont activate download file
7. ner detecting words without spaces (e.g: cap -- > handicap )
8. allow ner from a shared link
9. linkedin short url
10. scan for entities & no file
11. api.short - not working
12. save original text


To DO:
1. minimized venv
2. prettier popup message when file was selected
3. test additional docs
6. summary try and catch 
7. graph window should be size fixed, title
5. Documentation 


TESTS:
1. check scan entities with the url share link!
2. download summary from shared link
3. ner_graph (visualize, relatives)
4. long summaries variables via url ? need to check that url is not cut (maybe find a way to shorten)

** things that should be modified in case of relocating project:
1. path to save files from folder (in application.py)
2. load graph from server (create_graph in index.js file (currently from widget server))
3. path to fi_dictionary.xls (create_dictionary.py)
4. registartion form : index.html http://localhost/test/form.html"
5. index.js : var url = "local host address"
