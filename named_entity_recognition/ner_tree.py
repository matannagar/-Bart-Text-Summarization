    If the graph is a tree this will return the positions to plot this in a 
    hierarchical layout.

    G: the graph (must be a tree)

    root: the root node of current branch 
    - if the tree is directed and this is not given, 
      the root will be found and used
    - if the tree is directed and this is given, then 
      the positions will be just for the descendants of this node.
    - if the tree is undirected and not given, 
      then a random choice will be used.

    width: horizontal space allocated for this branch - avoids overlap with other branches

    vert_gap: gap between levels of hierarchy

    vert_loc: vertical location of root

    xcenter: horizontal location of root
